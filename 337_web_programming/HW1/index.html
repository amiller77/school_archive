    <h1> An Intro to Web Programming </h1>

    <h2> What is HTML? </h2>
    <p>
      HTML is considered a “markup” language, rather than a
      “programming” language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, HTML is used only to declare “what” the different components
      of a website are (link, paragraph, etc.) rather than to format
      or stylize in a detailed sense – that is left to CSS for
      clarity and efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2> HTML Syntax </h2>
    <p> The syntax is organized by “tags,” which are enclose in brackets. </p>
    <p>
      “Tags” allow you to customize the appearance of a web page and its text,
      add to the header or body, and begin and end your HTML code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any tags which are nested must be fully encapsulated within the
      other tag; no “overlapping” tags.
    </p>

    <h2> What is CSS? </h2>
    <p>
      Whereas HTML is for content, CSS allows you to customize style, format,
       and appearance with an efficiency, ease, and clarity that cannot be
       reached by trying to do this functionality in HTML.
    </p>

    <h2> CSS Syntax </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> A CSS file consists of one or more rules </li>
      <li>
        A rule’s “selector” specifies the HTML element to which style
        properties should be applied.
      </li>
      <li> Choosing * as a selector selects all elements </li>
      <li>
        You can also choose multiple selectors to modify, or modify the same
        one several times in different groupings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Some Background Properties </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> background:	shorthand to set all background properties </li>
      <li> background-color:	fill background with color </li>
      <li> background-image:	place image in background </li>
      <li> background-position:	placement of background image in element </li>
      <li> background-repeat:	whether background image should be repeated </li>
      <li> background-attachment:	if background image scrolls with page </li>
    </ol>
